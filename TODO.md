## Long Term TODOS
- individual page ui
- landing page
- optimize preformance and make ui better adapt to mobile

- auth & comment section (set up drizzle orm with sql db)
- light/dark mode toggle
- redesign sidenav design to have reduce characters, weapons, artifacts ect into a tab to allow for heyseelie, archepelgo, akademiya and articles to have its own tab lie (https://m3.material.io/styles)
- convert client components to server (state in cookies or url)
