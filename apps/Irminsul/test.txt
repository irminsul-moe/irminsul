albedo weapon comparison: 

Ranked by order of recommendation.
Though there are a few 5-star weapons on this list, it is not recommended to specifically pull 5-star weapons for Albedo. It can cost more Primogems to obtain a desired 5-star weapon than a 5-star character and it’s difficult to justify even the strongest 5-stars over the 3-star Harbinger of Dawn.
The rankings below assume Albedo with no external buffs. Separate analyses with Gorou and other buffs can be found in the References.
Assumptions: C0 Albedo Level 90, Talents 9/9/9, 4Husk DEF/Geo/CRIT, KQM Standard substats.
1 Solar Isotoma hit, 10 Transient Blossom procs, (1 Tectonic Tide hit, 3 Fatal Blossom hits), no ER requirement*

Uraku Misugiri:
Uraku Misugiri is Albedo’s Best-in-Slot option thanks to its high CRIT DMG secondary stat, Elemental Skill DMG Bonus, and DEF% buff. Albedo and his Geo teammates can trigger the passive bonus on cast, so it should have good uptime in most teams.
R5 Cinnabar Spindle is still competitive, so it is generally not worth pulling for R1 Uraku Misugiri if you have already obtained Cinnabar.

Cinnabar Spindle
	111.3%
(R5)
98.9%
(R1)	118.7%
(R5)
103.7%
(R1)
Albedo’s best 4-star option. If you have it, use it.
Cinnabar Spindle was only obtainable as part of an event during Version 2.3.
If you do not Burst during your rotation, the gap between Cinnabar and other Swords grows even wider. Cinnabar’s passive is dynamic, meaning it does not snapshot any DEF buffs at the time you cast Albedo’s Skill.
Note that in teams with Gorou, the gap between Cinnabar and other Swords shrinks notably. The placements remain the same, however.
This weapon was available as an event reward during Version 2.3. If you were not able to claim it, then it is unfortunately no longer obtainable.

Harbinger of Dawn
	100.0%
Easily obtainable through Wishes, Harbinger of Dawn is Albedo’s best F2P option if you missed Cinnabar Spindle. Its passive is conditional upon Albedo staying above 90% HP, but this is usually easy to achieve with Albedo’s low field time requirements. Corrosion can be a problem though, so having a team healer is recommended against content that damages your characters through shields or while they are off-field.
Recommended if you don’t have Cinnabar Spindle. Harbinger of Dawn still performs admirably, especially considering its 3-star status. Just be careful with HP-draining effects, since the CRIT Rate buff from its passive will disappear if Albedo is below 90% HP.

Wolf-Fang
102.9%
(R5)

94.6%
(R1)	100.9%
(R5)

92.9%
(R1)
The CRIT Rate passive cannot gain stacks while Albedo is off-field, limiting him to 1 stack if you E>swap and 2 stacks if you E>N1>swap. Calculations are for E>N1>swap, but the difference is small, so just do whatever combo is most comfortable for you.

While slightly better than Harbinger of Dawn at R5, the miniscule damage increase does not justify spending $50. It may be the best 4-star option if you don’t have Cinnabar, but Harbinger of Dawn has much better value.
Can perform marginally better than Harbinger of Dawn at R5, but it’s definitely not worth buying the Battle Pass five times.

At R1, Wolf-Fang performs slightly worse than the 5-star options below, but might be a better deal than gambling on the weapon banner.

Just use Harbinger of Dawn if possible.

Primordial Jade Cutter, Light of Foliar Incision, Haran Geppaku Futsu, Mistsplitter Reforged
These 5-star options are good stat sticks if you already have one on hand. They generally perform similarly to Harbinger of Dawn if Albedo uses his Burst. If he doesn’t use his Burst, then Harbinger of Dawn pulls ahead. The primary advantage of using these weapons is that Albedo doesn’t have to stay above 90% HP.

It is not recommended to pull a 5-star weapon specifically for Albedo. Just use Harbinger of Dawn.

Primordial Jade Cutter
	103.3%
(R1)	96.7%
(R1)	PJC’s high CRIT value and ATK buff on its passive make it the best 5-star option for Albedo if you use his Burst. However, it is only slightly ahead of Harbinger of Dawn, a 3-star weapon that is much more obtainable. Its damage falls below Harbinger of Dawn if you do not use Albedo’s Burst in your rotations.

Light of Foliar Incision or Haran Geppaku Futsu
	98.6%
(R1 LoFI)

97.5%
(R1 HGF)	97.5%
(R1 LoFI)

94.1%
(R1 HGF)	If you have a spare of either of these Swords, then they make a good alternative to Harbinger of Dawn without needing to stay above 90% HP. These are potent stat sticks with passives that are marginally useful to Albedo.

Mistsplitter Reforged
	97.6%
(R1, 2 stacks)

91.6%
(R1, 1 stack)	87.2%
(R1, 0 stacks)	Albedo is only able to gain at most 2 stacks from Mistsplitter’s passive. He can snapshot both stacks with his Skill, but casting his Skill immediately after his Burst will cancel his Fatal Blossoms. If you want the buff from both stacks, then you must either forgo his Fatal Blossoms or cast his Burst, wait for the Fatal Blossoms to go off, and then recast his Skill. Forgoing his Fatal Blossoms is a damage loss, but waiting for them to go off increases his field time.

All of that to say: we recommend just using his E-Q combo as normal and not worrying about trying to obtain 2 stacks.

Festering Desire or Traveler’s Handy Sword
	86.4%
(R5 Festering)

76.8%
(R5 Traveler’s)	88.3%
(R5 Festering)

77.3%
(R5 Traveler’s)	These are serviceable only if none of the above are available to you. If you are considering either of these weapons, we recommend just using Harbinger of Dawn if at all possible.

Festering Desire was available as an event reward during Version 1.2. If you did not claim it then, it is unfortunately no longer obtainable.

Traveler’s Handy Sword can be found in chests around Mondstadt.

Freedom-Sworn
	76.7%
(R1)

57.6%
(R1, 4ToM)	73.9%
(R1)

53.1%
(R1, 4ToM)	As long as there is a constant Elemental aura, Albedo’s Transient Blossoms can reliably proc Freedom-Sworn’s passive with Crystallize. It’s very difficult to get Freedom-Sworn’s buff onto Albedo’s Burst without extremely short rotations.

Freedom-Sworn also severely reduces his personal damage, even more so if used with a non-Husk artifact set. Since much of Albedo’s value comes from his personal damage, this should only be considered if you think the team buff is worth it. Please don’t do this.

*Realistically, Albedo will need some ER to Burst every rotation depending on your team. However, since his Burst contributes so little damage in comparison to his Skill, accounting for ER does not change his artifact/weapon rankings or recommendations.
