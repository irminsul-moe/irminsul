Albedo Constellations
Albedo Constellation 1 (C1) | Flower of Eden 
"Transient Blossoms generated by Albedo’s Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma regenerate 1.2 Energy for Albedo."
Damage increase over C0: 13-14% (0% if not using Burst)
The value of this Constellation depends heavily upon the team that Albedo is in. 
In teams where Albedo does not use his Burst or when he needs very little Energy Recharge, this Constellation is irrelevant.
However, if Albedo does Burst every rotation, then C1 reduces his ER needs significantly.
This can lower Albedo’s ER requirements if you use his Burst.
Constellation 2 (C2) | Opening of Phanerozoic \"Transient Blossoms generated by Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma grant Albedo Fatal Reckoning for 30s:\r\n\r\n• Unleashing Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide consumes all stacks of Fatal Reckoning. Each stack of Fatal Reckoning consumed increases the DMG dealt by Fatal Blossoms and Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide’s burst DMG by 30% of Albedo’s DEF.\r\n• This effect stacks up to 4 times.\"\r\nDamage increase over C1: 13-17%\r\nDamage increase over C0: 28-33%\r\n(0% if not using Burst)\r\n\r\nThe split scaling in Albedo’s base kit makes it difficult to invest in both ATK and DEF, forcing most players to neglect his Burst damage in favor of his more powerful Skill. C2 mostly solves these split scaling issues and makes all of his abilities scale at least partially with DEF. This Constellation is difficult to evaluate, in part because its value is highly dependent on Albedo Bursting, which is not always optimal for some teams (such as Xiao teams). However, if Albedo Bursts regularly, this Constellation is very valuable.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that C1 and C2 are directly synergistic. C2 without C1 would be a much worse Constellation because C1 makes using Albedo’s Burst outside of high Geo Energy generation teams viable without tanking Albedo’s damage. However, C2 also gives meaning to C1 in said teams by making the Burst actually deal meaningful damage.\r\n\r\nNote that if Albedo does not optimally use his Burst in a team at C0, this Constellation will not change that.\r\nC2 allows Albedo’s Burst to scale with his DEF, bringing some cohesion to his kit. Even with C2, it may not always be worth it to use Albedo’s Burst.\r\n\r\nAlbedo 
Constellation 3 (C3) | Grace of Helios \"Increases the Level of Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma by 3.\r\nMaximum upgrade level is 15.\"\r\nDamage increase over C2: 10-13%\r\nDamage increase over C0: 42-50%\r\n\r\nC3 is an upgrade to Albedo’s main damage source. This is a good Constellation, and it’s recommended to stop here if you are pulling for Constellations at all.\r\nAdds 3 levels to Albedo’s Skill, his main source of damage.\r\n\r\nAlbedo 
Constellation 4 (C4) | Descent of Divinity \"Active party members within the Solar Isotoma field have their Plunging Attack DMG increased by 30%.\"\r\n\r\nDamage increase over C3: 0%\r\nDamage increase over C0: 42-50%\r\n\r\nElevator memes aside, this Constellation is pretty useless for Albedo. It’s not even that useful for Xiao, given it only produces a small damage increase for him with little synergy otherwise. If Xiao is using a 2pc Viridescent Venerer 2pc ATK% artifact combo, he only gains about 2-8% total damage from this Constellation.\r\n\r\nIf Xiao is instead using 4pc Vermillion Hereafter — which does not confer any DMG% buffs — this Constellation gains some value.\r\n\r\nConversely, if Xiao is being buffed by Faruzan, the added DMG% from her buffs decreases this Constellation’s value.\r\nA highly niche support Constellation that provides a large buff to Plunging Attack damage. Only applicable in Xiao teams and Noelle teams where she performs Dragonstrikes. Even then, the damage increase does not justify pulling for this Constellation.\r\n\r\nAlbedo 
Constellation 5 (C5) | Tide of Hadean \"Increases the Level of Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide by 3.\r\nMaximum upgrade level is 15.\"\r\n\r\nDamage increase over C4: 1-3%\r\nDamage increase over C0: 44-53%\r\n\r\nThe extra Talent levels to Albedo’s Burst only affect his ATK-based multipliers. The bonus damage that scales with DEF from his C2 is unaffected. As such, the damage gained from C5 is minimal, provided Albedo uses his Burst to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe 3 extra levels to Albedo’s Burst only buff his ATK-based multipliers, not his DEF scaling from C2. The damage gained from this Constellation is minimal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbedo 
Constellation 6 (C6) | Dust of Purification \"Active party members within the Solar Isotoma field who are protected by a shield created by Crystallize have their DMG increased by 17%.\"\r\n\r\nDamage increase over C5: 0-1%\r\nDamage increase over C0: 45-55%\r\n\r\nC6 marginally strengthens Albedo’s capabilities as an off-field DPS by increasing the damage of his teammates. Note that just like the DMG% from Geo Resonance, this bonus only applies to on-field units and cannot be snapshot. This means that C6 has very little impact on Albedo himself and is only really beneficial for on-field teammates.\r\n\r\nC6 is a buff to teammates who have a shield. This increases Albedo’s supporting capabilities, but it doesn’t make him optimal in teams where he wasn’t already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
